**Packages**

 * Debian - user 'saintless' at Puppy Linux Forum helped me improve

   [DebianDog](http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=93225),
   a very small Debian Live CD shaped to look like and act like Puppy Linux,
   while keeping Debian structure, behaviour, and apt-get/synaptic
   access to Debian repositories.
