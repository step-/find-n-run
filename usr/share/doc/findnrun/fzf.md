## Fzf Search Engine

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is a versatile cross-platform
command-line fuzzy finder program.  Since version 4.0.0 findnrun integrates fzf
as a search engine alternative to its built-in fuzzy finder.

**Pros**

* Fzf is faster than the built-in search engine.
* Fzf's fuzzy search algorithm is smarter than the built-in one.
* Fzf's search syntax is more powerful than the built-in search syntax. Search
  for multiple terms (AND/OR), negate search terms, mix searching for fuzzy and
  exact terms, and more (refer to fzf's manual for details).
* With fzf installed, you can toggle search detail options (filename, comment
  and category) without needing to restart findnrun.
* Fzf (with full installation) can also be used outside findnrun, as a powerful
  tool to search for files, browse shell history, as an interactive alternative
  to grep, and much more.

**Cons**

* Fzf adds about 2 MB of disc space usage.
* Fzf doesn't support regular expressions, for which you can continue to use
  the built-in engine.
* Unlike the built-in fuzzy engine, Fzf doesn't underline the characters that
  matched your search term.

If additional disc space isn't a concern, we highly recommend installing fzf.
The pros far outweigh the cons.

### Installing Fzf

If command `fzf` is already installed in the shell `PATH`, fzf becomes the
default search engine automatically for both fuzzy and exact search. Fzf's
extended search syntax applies to both cases.

If `fzf` isn't found in `PATH`, findnrun shows a startup reminder that offers
to download and install fzf.  Such installation limits the scope of fzf to
findnrun - fzf won't be available for general command-line use.

If instead you wish to perform a complete fzf installation run command

    /usr/share/findnrun/install-fzf --help

in a terminal window. Read more about [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

### Uninstalling Fzf

To disable fzf see [FNRSEARCHENGINE](running.md).

To uninstall fzf delete file `/usr/share/findnrun/fzf`. If you performed a full
installation follow the uninstallation instructions found on fzf's website.
