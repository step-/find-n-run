## Introduction

Findnrun is a general finder packaged as an application starter script
that displays system applications in a graphical window. Search results
are refined and displayed incrementally as you type into a search input
field.  With the aid of external plugins findnrun can be extended to
search through other data collections.

Find'N'Run [started](CREDITS.md) as a Puppy Linux script in Spring 2015.
In May 2015 it forked into this newer project - named Findnrun - and it is
being developed and tested on
[Fatdog64](http://distro.ibiblio.org/fatdog/web/)-701 64-bit Linux, a
[Puppy Linux](http://puppylinux.com/) and
[LFS](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) derivative.

### Naming

 - _find-n-run_ refers to this new project and its repository.
 - _Find'N'Run_ refers to the _original_ project.
   It is also the main window title for both projects.
 - _Findnrun_ refers to this project.
   It is also the script _name_ for both projects - but of course
   the scripts are different.

## Overview

Main features:

 * **Fast incremental search** (find as you type)[1]
 * **Search Plugins** extend search to other data types
 * **Command line entry** with history.
 * **[Hotkeys](hotkey.md)**
 * **Browsable help**[2]
 * **[User preferences](preference.md)**
 * **Multiple-user, multiple-instance** support[3]
 * **Multi-language** support includes program and help documentation.

[1] Search applications by **name**, **command line**, **comments**, and
   **categories**, or all at once. Search **from left**, with **regular
   expressions**, **case-independently**.

[2] Markdown files can be confortably read as plain text files.
   To browse markdown files install the `mdview` package.

[3] Run multiple searches at the same time. Each search window is
   separate from other running instances. Use multiple preference
   files to tailor each instance to your needs.
