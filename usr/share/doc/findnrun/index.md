## Introduction

Findnrun is a general finder packaged as an application starter script
that displays system applications in a graphical window. Search results
are refined and displayed incrementally as you type into a search input
field.  With the aid of external plugins findnrun can be extended to
search through other data collections.

Findnrun started in May 2015 as a fork of [Find'N'Run](CREDITS.md), an
earlier project for Puppy Linux.

Currently Findnrun is being developed and tested on
[Fatdog64](http://distro.ibiblio.org/fatdog/web/)-701 64-bit Linux, a
[Puppy Linux](http://puppylinux.com/) and
[LFS](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) derivative.

Names can be confusing:

 * _find-n-run_ - this project and its online repository.
 * _Find'N'Run_ - the _earlier_ project, and also the main window title
   for both projects.
 * _findnrun_ - this project, and also the script _name_ for both
   projects - but the scripts are very different.

## Main features

 * **Fast incremental search** (find as you type)[1]
 * **Search Plugins** extend search to other data types
 * **Command line entry** with history.
 * **[Hotkeys](hotkey.md)**
 * **Browsable help**[2]
 * **[User preferences](preference.md)**
 * **Multiple-user, multiple-instance** support[3]
 * **Multi-language** support includes program and help documentation.

[1] Search applications by **name**, **command line**, **comments**, and
   **categories**, or all at once. Search **from left**, with **regular
   expressions**, **case-independently**.

[2] Markdown files can be confortably read as plain text files.
   To browse markdown files install the `mdview` package.

[3] Run multiple searches at the same time. Each search window is
   separate from other running instances. Use multiple preference
   files to tailor each instance to your needs.
