## Installing

It is recommended to install the latest full package for your
distribution, which is split into multiple sub-packages:

 * The _base_ package includes the main script, its `.desktop` file, and
   an English help file (markdown)
 * The optional _NLS_ package adds run-time translations in several
   languages

Installation [PRE-REQUISITES](DEBIAN.md):
ash (or bash[1]), gawk, gtk-dialog.

[1] if you only have bash on your system, you may need to do a one-time,
   post-install file edit. See the above link for details.

To read markdown help files you only need a text editor. However,
installing the _mdview_ markdown viewer for your platform is highly
recommended. Mdview is a small, single-file, GTK application that
displays markdown with clickable links.
