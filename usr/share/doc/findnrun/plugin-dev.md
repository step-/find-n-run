## Plugin Development

Before giving the theory, let's start with a complete example.

### The Find File example

You want to add a new source that lists the files in your home
folder. Selecting one of the files in the search result list should open
the filer - ROX-Filer in our case - in the folder that contains the
file, and with the file selected.

We will be implementing a so called tap/drain pair: the tap outputs
search results, the drain starts the filer. Here's how.

Save the following script in your home folder `$HOME/fnr-find-file.sh`
```
    #!/bin/sh
    find $HOME -type f -name "*$1*" | findnrun-formatter -- -O s
```

Edit file `$HOME/.findnrun` and add:
```
    TITLE_find_file='open ROX-Filer with file selected'
    TAP_find_file='"$HOME/fnr-find-file.sh" "${term}"'
    DRAIN_filer_select='rox -s'
    ICON_find_file='/usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/findnrun.png'
    # tap:drain:default_icon:title
    SOURCE_find_file='find_file:filer_select:find_file:find_file'
    SOURCES='FNRstart find_file'
```

Make your script executable:
```
    chmod +x $HOME/fnr-find-file.sh
```

Now every time you select the `find_file` source in the user interface
and type a character in the search field, `$HOME/fnr-find-file.sh`
starts and lists file names that partially match the search term and are
located inside and below your home folder. When you activate an entry
ROX-Filer starts with the given file selected - but how visibly selected
depends on the ROX-Filer version.

### Overview

Findnrun provides plugins with:

 * methods to _define_ and _install_ plugins
 * plugin _invocation_ in an _invocation environment_
 * a _call interface_ for a plugin to request execution of findnrun
   functions
 * a set of _services_

Plugins provide findnrun with new search types/methods, and optional
user interface elements.

### Source Plugins

A source plugin comprises a _tap_ and an optional _drain_. The tap outputs
the data records that populate the list widget. The drain consumes the
selected record when the user presses ENTER or double-clicks the list
view selection.

**Tap-record**

A tap-record consists of fields separated by the pipe character '|':
````
    <icon-reference> '|' <tap-reserved> '|' <label> '|' <tap-data> '|' <comment> '|' <categories>
````

All fields hold string values, which can include any character except '|'.
Caveat: no value can include a literal pipe character.
All values can be null except for `<tap-data>`.

 * `<icon-reference>` is an icon _reference_. See section _Findnrun User
   Interface and Source Plugins_.
 * `<tap-reserved>` is available for a plugin to associate special data
   to the tap-record for custom activation. Currently this field
   isn't processed or further exposed in the plugin interface awaiting
   feedback from plugin developers.
 * `<label>` is displayed in the list widget. If the label value is null
   findnrun uses tap-data instead.
 * `<tap-data>` is added to the history list and sent to the drain upon
   activating its entry in the search results list.
 * `<comment>` is displayed in the comment widget.
 * `<categories>` is a semicolon-separated list of words and can be
   displayed in the comment widget.

**Examples of well-formed records**

    american_icon||born to run|mplayer /root/bruce.mp3|the boss|multimedia;audio
    |command line||xterm -e sh||system
    |||chrome
    firefox

The last example shows the minimum data a well-formed record must
include. Accordingly, findnrun's list view displays a predefined icon,
label "firefox" and tap-data "firefox". Similarly, for record
`|||chrome` the list view shows a predefined icon, title "chrome" and
tap-data "chrome". To show an empty icon, set the filename of an empty
image. To show an empty label set a space character (" ").

### Declaring Source Plugins

In the following discussion:

 * An `<...-id>` is a valid shell variable name: only letters, digits,
   and underscore characters are allowed.
 * Characters outside of angle brackets are to be written literally.

A source plugin is installed by adding its declaration into
`.findnrunrc` as follows:
```
    SOURCE_<source-id>='<tap-id>:<drain-id>:<icon-id>:<title-id>:<init-search-id>:<mode-id>:<plgdir-id>:<saveflt-id>:<init-id>'
    TAP_<tap-id>='<tap-command>'                # code
    DRAIN_<drain-id>='<drain-command>'          # optional, code
    ICON_<icon-id>='<icon-name-or-filepath>'    # optional
    TITLE_<title-id>='<source-title>'           # optional
    INITSEARCH_<init-search-id>='<init-search>' # optional
    MODE_<mode-id>='<mode-mask>'                # optional
    PLGDIR_<plgdir-id>='<plugin-dir-path>'      # optional
    SAVEFLT_<filter-id>='<save-filter-command>' # optional, code
    INIT_<init-id>='<init-command>              # optional, code
```

 * Declarations marked 'code' are expected to contain shell source code
   fragments of the kind that shell's `eval` can interpret.
 * Declarations marked "optional" can be omitted by leaving their respective
   `<...-id>` slot empty in the `SOURCE_<source-id>` declaration.[1]
 * Each `<...-id>` identifier must be unique within its declaration
   group (SOURCE\_, TAP\_, DRAIN\_, ICON\_, TITLE\_, INITSEARCH\_, MODE\_,
   PLGDIR\_, SAVEFLT\_, INIT\_).
 * Given a declaration `SOURCE_<source-id>`, the other <...-id>`s in the
   declaration may be the same word, which can be `<source_id>`. In fact, this
   is the most common case, e.g.,

    SOURCE_My=My:My:My:My:My:My:My:My:My
    TAP_My=...
    DRAIN_My=...
    ...
    INIT_My=...

 * `<tap-command>` is any valid shell command.
 * `<drain-command>` is any valid shell command.
 * `<icon-name-or-filepath>` is a GTK icon name[2] or the full path to a supported icon image file.
 * `<source-title>` is displayed in the user interface.
 * `<init-search>` can be used to initialize the search input field.
 * `<mode-mask>` is a bit mask of plugin modifiers, e.g. "disabled".
 * `<plugin-dir-path>` is the location of the plugin resource files, if any.
 * `<save-filter-command>` is any valid shell command.
 * `<init-command>` is any valid shell command.
 * Embedded newline or carriage return characters are not allowed in
   `<...-command>` values.
 * All values are quoted strings. Paired exterior double quotes work just as
   well as single quotes, but require escaping interior double quotes and shell
   special characters.

[1] A common pitfall is declaring, say, `INIT_My="command"` but forgetting to
   insert `INIT_My` in its correct slot of `SOURCE_My`.  If you do so,
   the declaration of `INIT_My` will be ignored.

[2] An icon name refers to an existing icon file in the current GTK user theme
   or fallback theme (hicolor), or is a GTK stock icon name. If none of these
   conditions is met you must declare the full path to the icon file.

You can use any valid shell variable name as an `<...-id>`, but
prefix "FNR" is reserved for findnrun's own plugins.

 * Examples of valid `<id>`s: drain27, acme\_1.
 * Examples of invalid `<id>`s: my-plugin (shell identifiers can't
   include "-"), FNR\_plugin (prefix "FNR" is reserved), 100 (numbers
   aren't valid shell variable names).

### Installing Source Plugins

To install a source plugin edit `$SHOME/.findnrunrc` and add the
plugin `<source-id>` to the space-separated list `SOURCES`. When
findnrun starts it validates the declaration of all installed
plugins. The main window shows visible plugins in the order they appear
in `SOURCES`.
```
    SOURCES='... <source-id> ...'    # list of all enabled sources
```

A plugin may provide findnrun with well-known resource files by setting
`<plugin-dir-path>` to the container of the files. Findnrun
looks for the following optional files in `<plugin-dir-path>`:

 * `index.md` - Press `F1` when the plugin is active to open this
   plugin-specific help file in addition to the standard help file.

### Plugin Capabilities

By default an installed plugin is validated, allocated and visible.
In a plugin declaration `<mode-mask>` modifies plugin capabilities.
Calculate this decimal value as the Bitwise And of the following bit
values:
```
    0x1  DISABLED  Plugin is installed/validated but disabled/invisible/unallocated
    0x2  HIDDEN    Plugin is installed/validated/allocated but invisible *NOT IMPLEMENTED*
```

**Disabling a plugin**
```
    # tap:drain:default_icon:title:search_term:mode_bit_mask
    SOURCE_find_file='find_file:filer_select:find_file:find_file::disabled'
    MODE_disabled=1
    SOURCES='FNRstart find_file'
```

### Implementing Plugin Commands

Each tap-, drain- and save-filter-command is implemented as a shell
command, script, or external program, something that the shell can
execute.

### Plugin Invocation

Findnrun _invokes_ four kinds of commands. When a source is first
invoked at program start, the init-command is invoked as follows:
```
    eval <init-command>
```
This is where a plugin can do all sorts of private initializations. The
init-command is invoked once only.

While the user is typing into the search innput field, findnrun invokes the
tap-command as follows:
```
    eval <tap-command>
```
The tap-command can use the current value of the search input field by
including the string `${term}` in `<tap-command>`.  On each plugin
invocation the tap may output zero or more formatted tap-records.

When the user selects and activates an entry in the list view, findnrun
invokes the drain-command as follows:
```
    eval <drain-command> <tap-data>
```

Just before starting the command findnrun saves the invocation command,
without "eval ", into the history list pull-down widget.[1]
If the drain-command value is null findnrun starts `<tap-data>` with the
shell builtin command `eval`.

[1] Findnrun's _history service_ also saves two other history files: the
   global history file and the plugin's history file. Currently these files
   are not exposed in the user interface, and the pull-down widget shows
   the global history. This might change in the future.

When the user presses hotkey `F4` findnrun saves the raw search results to a
file and invokes save-filter-command as follows:
```
    eval <save-filter-command>
```

### Invocation Environment

The _invocation environment_ provides tap-, drain, save-filter- and init-
commands with the following preset variables:

 * `${SOURCE}`, `${TAP}`, `${DRAIN}`, `${ICON}`, `${TITLE}`, `${INITSEARCH}`,
   `${MODE}`, `${PLGDIR}`, `${SAVEFLT}` and `${INIT}` - from the source
   declaration
 * `${ID}` - the source-id
 * `${NSOURCES}` - number of sources
 * `${THISFILE}` - the shell file that sets all of the above variables.

 * `${FNRPID}` - findnrun gtkdialog process id [1]
 * `${FNRTMP}` - findnrun temporary folder full path [2]
 * `${FNREVENT}` - invocation event name [3]
 * `${FNRRPC}` - call interface mailbox file, see section _Remote Call Interface_
 * `${FNRDEBUG}` - findnrun debugging level 1-9.

For save-filter-command these additional variables can be used:

 * `${FNRSAVEFLT}` - predefined save-filter code used by built-in sources[4]

[1] Value is `NA` if gtkdialog isn't running.

[2] Findnrun's own temporary folder persists across plugin command
   invocations.  It is automatically deleted when findnrun terminates.
   Plugins are required to store their resource files in a fixed
   sub-folder of `${FNRTMP}`. Specifically, the shell initialization
   stanza of a plugin resource folder named `${TMPD}` is:
```
    TMPD="${FNRTMP:-/tmp}/.${ID}" && mkdir -p "${TMPD}" && chmod 700 "${TMPD}"
```

[3] Name of the event that led to the invocation of a tap or
   drain. Currently the following names are defined:

 * **Search** - Tap - Input entered in the search input field. When a
   tap is first invoked this event fires even without pressing an input
   key.
 * **PageUp** - Tap - PageDown key pressed when the search input field
   has the focus.
 * **PageDown** - Tap - PageUp key pressed when the search input field
   has the focus.
 * **Activate** - Drain - Enter key pressed or mouse left-clicked when a
   search result list item has the focus.

[4] See section _Saving Search Results_.

### Findnrun User Interface and Source Plugins

By default, when findnrun starts and no source plugins are installed,
it displays the list of desktop (file) applications, which is connected
to the builtin source `ID` "FNRstart". Effectively, the default source
installation is:
```
    SOURCES='FNRstart'
```

Since version 2.0.0 the "shell completion" plugin is bundled, so the
amended default source installation is:
```
    SOURCES='FNRstart FNRsc'
```

On program start findnrun displays the tap-records of the first element
of SOURCES. So declaring `SOURCES='FNRsc FNRstart'` would display the
shell-completion plugin on program start. Declaring `SOURCES='FNRsc'`
would disable the builtin FNRstart source. `SOURCES=MySourceOnly` would
be a dedicated "MySourceOnly" application for a suitable MySourceOnly
plugin.

When `SOURCES` includes multiple elements, a status bar appears at the
bottom of the main window. The status bar includes the current source's
source-title. If the source-title value is null, findnrun displays the
plugin's source-id value instead. Pressing F3 cycles the list view
through the sources. Pressing Ctrl+_i_, for _i_=1,2,..,9 displays the
_i_-th source directly.

The first column of the list view displays the tap-record
icon-reference. If the icon-reference value is null, findnrun displays
the source default icon set by `ICON_<icon-id>`. If also the default
icon is null findnrun displays an empty cell.

**Icon Format**

Icon resources are PNG, SVG, and XPM 32x32 images. Larger sizes,
i.e. 64x64, make search result list rows taller. Scalable icons, that is
SVG files, are recommended whenever possible.

**Icon References**

Simply put, an _icon reference_ is an icon file path that is formatted
in a way and located in a place where gtkdialog knows how to use
it. Gtkdialog follows freedesktop.org's rules for enumerating
icons. Icon files must be placed in specific directories, the details
of which are beyond the scope of this section. Suffice it to say that
findnrun automatically takes care of making the default source icon
visible to gtkdialog. The default icon is declared with `ICON_<icon-id>`.

If all that your plugin needs in terms of icons is the default icon you
need read no further.  But if your plugin needs to generate its own icon
column, with icons that differ from the default icon, then findnrun
can't automatically generate icon references for your icon column and
your plugin needs to take care of that directly. So then you need to
understand what an _icon reference_ is.

The _reference_ is the filename only part (no path and no extension)
of an icon image file. The file must be placed _under_ one of
the directories listed in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, a freedesktop.org
exported configuration variable. Findnrun conveniently adds
a path to this variable, and your plugin can copy its icons
there.

 * Copy or link each `icon` as `${FNRTMP}/icons/$(basename icon)`
 * Do not create new sub-folders - gtkdialog will not display icons from
   those sub-folders
 * Do not delete existing files and sub-folders that you do not own -
   this is a shared location.
 * This is also a temporary location that exists only while findnrun
   is running.  If a temporary directory isn't suitable for your needs,
   copy (or link) your icons in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` before findnrun starts.

**Paginating Search Results**

When a tap returns more items that can fit in the search result list
widget, the user can paginate through the list. There are two cases,
with the second case of greater relevance to plugin development.

First case: The search result list has the focus and the user presses
the PageUp or PageDown key to paginate through the list. The list widget
scrolls up and down the list accordingly. Nothing new here, it's the
standard handling of Page keys for a list widget.

Second case: The seach _input_ field has the focus and the user presses
the PageUp or PageDown keys. Findnrun invokes the tap with variable
`$FNREVENT` set to the event name, either `PageUp` or `PageDown`. It
is up to the source tap implementation to respond appropriately to the
event:

 * Ignore the event name altogether and return its standard search
   output.  The default source `FNRstart` is an example of this case.
 * Return a subset of its search results to represent a "page" of data.
   [Plugin Filmstrip](plugin-examples.md) is an example of this case.

It's worth noting that the definition of a "page" is left entirely to
the tap implementation. For example, `filmstrip` defines the page as
the number of thumbnails, five, that fit in its viewer window, and
pages the search result list up/down by five lines each time the
PageDown/PageUp key is pressed.

### Call Interface

Write function calls to the mailbox file `${FNRRPC}`.  A call consist of
a list of function names - each name is a single word - followed by a
serialization number. Findnrun executes recognized calls. For instance,
a process could ask findnrun to execute functions foo1 and foo2
in this way:
```
    date +"foo1 foo2 %s" > "${FNRRPC}"
```

The Linux date command interprets '+' as introducing a format string,
and replaces '%s' with the serialization number. So, for example
"foo1 foo2 1234567890" (any number) is written into the mailbox file.

Caveat: the order of execution of `foo1` and `foo2` is undefined
within the same call. Thus, findnrun could execute `foo1` before or
after `foo2`. If your plugin relies on a fixed order of execution send
separate calls.

Recognized calls:

 * `ExitFNR` - exit findnrun (this function is always executed last)
 * `PresentMainWindow` - raise findnrun's main window to top and give it
   the focus
 * `PresentMainSearchInput` - `PresentMainWindow` and set focus to the
   search input field
 * `RestartSearch` - reset search input field to `<init-search>` and
   invoke `<tap-command>`
 * `PageUp` - Paginate up, cf. _Paginating Search Results_
 * `PageDown` - Paginate down

### Saving Search Results

When the user presses hotkey `F4` findnrun saves the raw search results to a
file and invokes save-filter-command. Built-in sources use a predefined
save-filter-command, which is exported to the SAVEFLT invocation environment as
`${FNRSAVEFLT}`. Your plugin can use it or define a custom save filter
altogether.

FNRSAVEFLT's behavior can be tuned via environment variables `CUT` and `RDR`,
which can be set also in file [~/.findnrunrc](preference.md). `CUT` selects
which columns to save, and `RDR` defines where to save them (a filepath or a
command pipe).

For details please read the FNRSAVEFLT source code in the findnrun script file,
and look at the definitions of `SAVEFLT_FNRstart`, `SAVEFLT_FNRsc` and
`SAVEFLT_filmstrip` for inspiration.

When FNRSAVEFLT is used:

* Findnrun displays a confirmation dialog when the data is saved to a filepath.
* The filepath must exist (except its last component, the filename, which may not).

When a custom save filter is used:

* it can get input data by reading file `${file}`.

### Findnrun Termination and Plugins

When findnrun terminates it deletes its temporary folder and all
files/folder within, which become inaccessible to running plugins. Of
course, also the plugins terminate. However, if a plugin spawned a
running sub-process, i.e., a user interface module, such as a plugin's
own gtkdialog, that sub-process will keep running. Findnrun does nothing
to stop it.

Findnrun's _killing service_ can terminate other processes
automatically. Before exiting findnrun looks under its temporary folder
for files named `.pidof_*` and gathers their contents, which must
consist solely of process and process groups ids. Then findnrun sends a
termination signal to those ids:
```
    /bin/kill -TERM -- ${ids}
```

So a plugin can subscribe to findnrun's killing service if it needs
for its sub-process(es) to be automatically terminated when findnrun
exits. To subscribe write the sub-process id(s) to a suitably-named
`.pidof_*` file under findnrun's temporary folder.

### Plugin Internationalization (i18n)

Source-titles are looked up for using GNU Gettext in text domain
"findnrun-plugin-PLUGIN-ID", where _PLUGIN-ID_ stands for the
`<source-id>` value.

As a minimum translators should add a translation for the plugin title
defined with TITLE\_PLUGIN-ID=... in the plugin installed definition
section of file `~/.findnrunrc`. Plugin developers must provide
such installation information to translators. Further reading about
[translations](TRANSLATING.md).

### Formatter

At the moment, all non-builtin source tap-commands are **required** to
end with `| findnrun-formatter --` optionally followed by formatter
options. This constraint might be removed in the future. So the typical
tap-command stanza is:
```
    <command> | findnrun-formatter -- [ <formatter-options> ]
```

If tap-command outputs single records, that is, the records don't
include "|" (pipe), then do include option `-O s`, which tells the
formatter not to decode each tap-record in detail.

Run `findnrun-formatter -- -h` for usage information. Note again the
double dashes in the formatter command line: they are required before
any other options.

### Plugin Performance

Please note that the active source plugin's tap-command is invoked on
every keypress. So it's very important for tap-commands to return as
quickly as possible otherwise they could slow down the user interface to
a crawl.

Note also that since gtkdialog can't display streaming data, a
tap-command must close its output stream for gtkdialog to start
populating the search list view.
