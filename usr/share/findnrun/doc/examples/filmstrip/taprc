# Predefined custom caption functions. No change below. {{{1
# A custom caption function must output a list of records and nothing
# else.  Record format:
#  <record> ::=  <image full pathname>'|'<caption text>
# Characters '/', '|', newline (\n) and carriage return (\r) aren't
# allowed in <caption text>.  Do not output empty lines.
#
# The custom caption function is invoked when the search result cache is
# being built if $CACHE_LIST is 'true', and on each character typed into
# the search input field otherwise. The invocation command is:
#
#     ${CUSTOM_CAPTION} <file pathname>
# where <file pathname> is an input file that lists the pathnames of all
# found image files, one pathname per line. Do not overwrite or delete
# the contents of <file pathname>.

exif_caption_abstract () # $1-image-list-filepath [$2-ExifTool-tag] {{{2
# Function exif_caption_abstract extracts ExifTool tag values from
# image files to generate their captions. The ExifTool command must be
# pre-installed.
# $1 is an input file that lists the pathnames of all image files, one
# pathname per line.
# $2 is optional. Its purpose is explained next.
# A caption is formed by concatenating the values of the following tags:
# $2 (default name Caption-Abstract), Source, ImageSize, FileSize, FileName.
# Thus $2 links to the opening text of a caption.
#
# To call function exif_caption_abstract with a custom value for $2:
# 1. Name and define a custom tag in your ~/.ExifTool_config file
# 2. Define a custom caption function in this file as:
#
#      exif_caption_foo () exif_caption_abstract 'MyExifToolTag'
#
#    where 'MyExifToolTag' is the custom tag that you defined in step 1
# 3. Finally set CUSTOM_CAPTION=exif_caption_foo in this file.
